Relational Model Versus Document Model


P29
There are several driving forces behind the adoption of NoSQL databases, including:
• A need for greater scalability than relational databases can easily achieve, including
very large datasets or very high write throughput
• A widespread preference for free and open source software over commercial
database products
• Specialized query operations that are not well supported by the relational model
• Frustration with the restrictiveness of relational schemas, and a desire for a more
dynamic and expressive data model [5]


The Object-Relational Mismatch

if data is stored in
relational tables, an awkward translation layer is required between the objects in the
application code and the database model of tables, rows, and columns. The disconnect
between the models is sometimes called an impedance mismatch.


JSON has the appeal of
being much simpler than XML. Document-oriented databases like MongoDB [9],
RethinkDB [10], CouchDB [11], and Espresso [12] support this data model.
